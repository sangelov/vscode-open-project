# Visual Studio Code Open Project  
This is my Visual Studio Extensibility Playground

The extension allows you to easily switch projects inside Visual Studio Code

## Project Settings 
You can create a map (name -> folder) in the configuration

That will launch a new Visual Studio Code instance with the correct project.

## Change Project Command
Change Project is the same as Open Project, but it changes the current working folder instead of launching a new Visual Studio Code instance.

## Change Current Folder Command
Change Current Folder shows input where you should enter the folder path you want to change. The command replaces the current working folder.
